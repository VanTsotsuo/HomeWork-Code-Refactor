Code Refactor Homework

This website demonstrates the importance of accessibility, semantics, and clean code.
Businesses need proper structure in their code to avoid legal litigation. So it is very important that your code can be read by screen readers. I have fixed the code to include proper formatting not only for the end-user but also for whoever I want to read or make changes to my code. Within my HTML file, I have added proper descriptions so screen readers will be able to find content for the user in a logical order without it jumping to random places in the HTML Doc. All images have alt descriptions, and redundant code has been taken out on both HTML and CSS.

This is a copy of the site rendared.
